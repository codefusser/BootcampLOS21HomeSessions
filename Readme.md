# A Simple Command line Application that consumes a Public API using a HTTP Client library

This is a repo for the Boot camp exercises. It will contain well simplified steps for performing simple programming concepts in Javascript.

# How-To
You can change the location for which you want the weather information. At the end of the api HTTP URL, where you find Lagos, carefully, change the Lagos to whatever location you want e.g. london, kenya, paris etc.

You can also use the 'weatherInfo.current.condition.text' to see the exact weather condition in text format. Replace that in the console.log(weatherInfo); line
